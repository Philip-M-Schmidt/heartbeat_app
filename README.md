Measurement of the tip of the indexfinger by holding your finger on the main camera. Image ist processed by the modulation of the microvascularization which moves the skin of the finger. Viewable by the camera if you look closely:

Bad result with artifacts. This app is created to give a basic understanding of the heartbeat and its measurement from the fingertip to any programmer which is interested in medical software projects:
